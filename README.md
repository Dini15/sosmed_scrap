# sosmed_scrap
This project aims to scrapping social media data to help users measure the performance of every content that had been built by the Individual Contractor. I use BeautifulSoup and Selenium in this case, setting the time pause to stop executing code for desired amount of time to make sure my code doesn't recognized as bot by the server.
